documentation of the Mapbox environment, an interactive map has been created that allows
the exploration of game content in the form of urban space objects implemented in the world
of virtual reality in the area of Poznań. Based on the application usability tests, an interface
has been created that allows navigating the world of Pokemon Go, users of both desktop
computers and smartphones. The following work describes in detail the process of creating a
navigation app and introduces the content and mechanics related to the operation of mobile
games based on augmented, virtual or hybrid reality.*
